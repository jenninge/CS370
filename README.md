# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

This project utilized Deep Q-Learning to solve a treasure hunting game. The goal was to train an AI agent to solve the maze with the shortest path and with a 100%-win rate. The code provided included two python classes which was to create the game environment, and to store the episodes which contains the states in between the start and end of the game. A Jupyter Notebook was also provided which included code to play the game. I created the code to train the agent to solve the maze and find the treasure. The agent used exploration/exploitation to choose an action, then based off that action it would update its state, reward, and game status. Each episode was stored in an experience replay object to be used for future learning. 

# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists help develop and improve software and systems. They also can perform data analysis and data maintenance that is key to business architecture. Computer scientists are important because they continually improve different industries such as healthcare, finance, engineering, and more. 

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I approach a problem by first identifying the problem. Then I identify a goal to set an achievable target. I would create small manageable goals to lay out a plan to achieve that goal. As with programming, writing small sections of code and testing makes it easier to create a fully functioning program than creating everything at once. 

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

A goal as a computer scientist is to create the best product possible while also making the end user/organization happy. However, it is important to ensure the program maintains standards such as maintaining security of data, ensuring data privacy, and that the program itself is for the greater good of humanity. A computer scientist should have the goal of creating products that makes userâ€™s lives easier and increases the overall well-being of society.
